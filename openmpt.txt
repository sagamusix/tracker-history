# Summary: Modplug 'Wild' first release
#
# Modplug 'Wild' is the experimental branch. We developer new features
# that are potentially risky. This is the first release: 2.00.0001 
# In this version you can find ehanced VST support, mix paste, visualization
# of effects and other goodies from Rewbs. And 255 channel mode, you need
# a fast machine if you attempt all 255 channels.
